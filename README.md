# AVR-IoT Quick Start

This repository contains the tutorials and files needed to connect your AVR-IoT device to your own Google Project and deploy a site to Firebase. Once you've completed the tutorial, you'll be all set to view your live data.

Before getting started, you'll need to **create a GCP project and enable billing**, and **create a Firebase project and link it to your GCP project**.
